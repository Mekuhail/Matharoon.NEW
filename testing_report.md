## Matharoon Game Development - Final Test Report

**Project:** Matharoon - Fun Math Games & Learning Platform
**Date:** May 10, 2025

**Objective:** This report summarizes the final testing phase of the Matharoon project, focusing on the implementation of new features and enhancements as outlined in the project specifications.

**Testing Summary:**

Overall, the application is functioning as expected. All major features implemented according to the requirements document have been tested. The following key areas were validated:

1.  **User Registration and Login:**
    *   Successfully created a new user account.
    *   Successfully logged in with the new user account.
    *   Successfully logged in with the existing user account (N@N.com).
    *   Username filter for inappropriate words is working as intended.
    *   Dark mode preference is saved and applied correctly after login.

2.  **Game Features:**
    *   **RoonRun Game (Core Gameplay):**
        *   Successfully navigated to the RoonRun game page.
        *   Player character (Roonie) loads and is controllable.
        *   Obstacles (Cube, Sphere, Cone, Pyramid) are generated and appear correctly.
        *   Collision detection with obstacles is functional.
        *   Scoring mechanism is working as expected.
        *   Game over condition (e.g., hitting an obstacle) triggers the appropriate game state.
        *   Game restart functionality is working.
    *   **RoonRun Game (Visuals & Audio):**
        *   Pixel art styling for characters and obstacles is consistent with the design document.
        *   Background animations (scrolling mathematical symbols, equations) are implemented and functioning.
        *   Sound effects for jumping and collisions are implemented and working.
        *   Background music is implemented and plays as expected.
    *   **Leaderboard:**
        *   Scores are correctly recorded and displayed on the leaderboard.
        *   Leaderboard can be filtered by grade level (though specific grade level data was not tested in this iteration).
    *   **General UI/UX:**
        *   Navigation between different game sections (e.g., main menu, game, leaderboard) is smooth.
        *   User interface elements are responsive and display correctly across different screen sizes (simulated).
        *   Dark Mode functionality is implemented and working correctly.

3.  **Additional Features:**
    *   **Countdown Timer:** The 3-second countdown timer before starting a game is implemented and functions correctly.
    *   **Firebase Integration:** User data persistence (scores, preferences) using Firebase is operational. User authentication with Firebase is working.
    *   **Yandex Ads Integration (Placeholder):** Placeholder for Yandex Ads integration is present. Actual ad serving was not tested as it requires live ad network configuration.

**Issues and Bugs Encountered:**

*   No major bugs were identified during this testing phase that would prevent the core functionality of the application.
*   Minor UI/UX issues identified during development were addressed and resolved.

**Conclusion:**

The Matharoon game, with its new features and enhancements, has passed the final testing phase. The application is stable and all core functionalities are working as designed. The game is now ready for packaging and deployment.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Package the final deliverables.
2.  Prepare release notes and documentation.
3.  Deploy the application to the production environment.
